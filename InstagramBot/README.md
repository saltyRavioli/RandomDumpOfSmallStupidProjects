# InstagramBot
## Description:
W e l l . . .<br>
Clearly actually scrolling through Instagram to like posts is a huge waste of time and is kinda just there so why not be super innovative and make a bot like those posts for you? ~~This way it seems like you might actually care.~~ Also doesn't looking through stories bother you? Yes? ~~Well time to implement that one day.~~
## Libraries used
* pyautogui 0.9.52 https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
