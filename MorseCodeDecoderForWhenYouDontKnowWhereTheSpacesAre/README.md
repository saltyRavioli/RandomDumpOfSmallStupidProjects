# MorseCodeDecoderForWhenYouDontKnowWhereTheSpacesAre
## Decription:
Literally just... well... exactly what the title says <br>
Brute forces a <code>String</code> containing . and - then finds all possible combinations of what the <code>String</code> might be. Uses International Morse Code because literally no sane human uses American Morse Code anymore
## Backstory:
Sometimes *someone* (actually multiple people) will find random Morse Code stuff and get me to decode it through listening to it. I am not fluent in Morse Code and will literally only be able to understand Morse Code if it's written down and I know where the spaces are. When listening to Morse Code I can't really tell where the spaces are because I'm bad.
